*  [Multicast Distance Vector Forwarding in NDN Networks](https://vixra.org/abs/2508.0008), paper about multicast strategies for Named Data Networking, an alternate internet architecture to IP.

## Personal Projects
*  Going through MySQL Vitess source code just to learn.
*  Poker platform (moving off of AWS).
*  Modification to MySQL to retrieve data faster by 10x (in-memory storage engine).
*  Autocorrect for text, images, links etc. for Markdown files (Language Server).
*  Saving LLM training costs by compressing information and making it train-able across different machines simultaneously (making QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) work for FSDP2 (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)).
*  Tinkering with Linux kernel to use a better version of multicast networking (e.g., for Zoom calls) (as per my research in Named Data Networking Multicast strategies).
*  Language learning app for Chinese/English speakers.
*  Program to translate different queries across different SQL-based languages so users only need to speak 1 dialect of SQL.
*  Making Postgres 7x faster on "stable" data by making the query planner select better query ordrers (e.g., "A join B then join C" instead of "A join C then join B") (Penalty-aware Robust Plan Selection in Query Optimisation).
