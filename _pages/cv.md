Talks
======

 * I gave a talk on the Tate construction, and using it to compute the coefficient ring of an RO(G)-graded cohomology theory, following [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09365) of Greenless in the UCLA participating algebraic topology seminar on 10/21/2022.
 * [A talk](https://youtu.be/9uUiMoB8A9g) I gave on Chapter 1 of Elements of Infinity Category Theory by Riehl and Verity as a part of a higher category theory  reading seminar organized by Amartya, Vaibhav, Varun (see Miscellaneous page) and myself.  [Chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FPgUGhG-rI) of Elements as a part of the same learning seminar.\
  
Teaching
======
  * I taught a Math 197 under the supervision of Professor Balmer during Summer 2022, where I gave weekly lectures on higher algebraic K theory following (in part) Weibel, and also Quillen's original paper on the subject.
  
Related Things
======
  * During Fall 2022, I am organizing a reading group on Lurie's Higher Algebra with some people at my school.
