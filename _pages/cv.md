Organizational
======
  * During Winter 2022-2023, together with [Jacob Swenberg](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jaswenberg/), I am co-organizing the [participating number theory seminar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jaswenberg/ntlearning/) at UCLA, following the Berkeley lectures on p-adic geometry.

  * During Fall 2022, I organized a reading group on the first chapter of Lurie's Higher Algebra together with some friends at my school.


Talks
======
 * On 11/29/2022, I gave another talk in the UCLA participating number theory seminar, introducing concepts of nonarchimedean functional analysis, Berkovich spaces, and eigenvarieties.
 * [You Could Have Condensed Mathematics](/files/YouCouldHaveCondensedMath.pdf), slides from a talk I gave on 11/18/2022 to undergraduates at UCLA.  (The slides leave out a lot of details in order to try to make the material more accessible, for an honest, yet more technical talk, see the recording from the talk below this one).
 * I gave a talk introducing condensed math and analytic geometry in the [study seminar on homotopy theory and applications](https://researchseminars.org/talk/HomotopyTheoryAndApps/46/) on 11/11/2022, presenting topics out of Clausen and Scholze's lectures on [condensed math](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf) and [analytic geometry](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf).  (The video should be available at the link on researchseminars.org).
 * I gave a talk introducing ordinary Lambda-adic modular forms, and describing a structure theorem for them in the [UCLA participating number theory seminar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jaswenberg/ntlearning/ntlearning22F.html) on 10/25/2022.  <!--- (I survived giving a talk to Professor Hida during the Hida theory seminar!) -->
 * I gave a talk on the Tate construction, and using it to compute the coefficient ring of an RO(G)-graded cohomology theory, following [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09365) of Greenless in the UCLA participating algebraic topology seminar on 10/21/2022.
 * [A talk](https://youtu.be/9uUiMoB8A9g) I gave on Chapter 1 of Elements of Infinity Category Theory by Riehl and Verity as a part of a higher category theory  reading seminar organized by Amartya, Vaibhav, Varun (see Miscellaneous page) and myself.  [Chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FPgUGhG-rI) of Elements as a part of the same learning seminar.
  
Teaching
======
  * I taught a Math 197 under the supervision of Professor Balmer during Summer 2022, where I gave weekly lectures on higher algebraic K theory following (in part) Weibel's K book, and Quillen's original paper on the subject.
  

Other
======
* During Winter 2022-2023, I am doing a DRP with [Matthew Ghermann](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mgherman/) on Part 1 of [The Algebraic and Geometric Theory of Quadratic Forms](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~karpenko/publ/Kniga.pdf).
