This is the website for the summer 2023 UCLA (and friends) number theory learning seminar, where will be learning prismatic cohomology.  We will meet once per week on Tuesdays at 3-4pm PDT at first for developing the theory.  After talk 4, we will have two talks per week, the second talk every week being on Fridays at 3-4pm PDT on applications of prismatic cohomology (times may be subject to change depending on speaker availability).  The talks will be recorded and posted below.

We will also be making a document filled with examples of various computations in prismatic cohomology as we go, which will be posted here after the seminar has concluded.

Here is the [syllabus](https://www.overleaf.com/read/bcscdgtwdqfb) for the seminar.
