*  [Cyclotomic Idempotents](/files/CycId.pdf), a brief note proving that the idempotent algebras in genuine cyclotomic spectra are in bijection with the idempotent algebras of spectra, giving the smashing spectrum of cyclotomic spectra.  Correction made 5/19/2023 to the case of general E-infty algebras in cyclotomic spectra.
*  [Pro-etale stacks](/files/proetalestack.pdf), notes to accompany a talk I gave on how to use pro-etale descent to classify certain algebraic groups over an arbitrary field, such as 1-dimensional tori.
