Hello, my name is Lucas Hou!

Some facts about me: I enjoy skiing and winetasting, lately I seem to be listening to a lot of Frank Ocean, and I love matcha.

Currently I am trying to get my ski instructor certification and learn Russian.

## Interests

I am primarily interested in homotopy theory and CS.

As Alan Greenberg once said, I am a PSD.
