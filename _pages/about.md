I am currently a second year undergraduate at UCLA. I will try to update this later with more facts about me, but for now I enjoy sailing, doing math, and I have ADHD.  To be expanded on at some point (hopefully).

**Interests**
At the moment, I find myself primarily (though not an exhaustive list) interested in condensed math and analytic geometry, higher category theory, especially the cosmological approach, higher representation theory, Khovanov homology, and tensor triangulated geometry.
