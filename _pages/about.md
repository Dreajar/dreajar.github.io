Hello, my name is Logan Hyslop, and I am currently a second year undergraduate at UCLA, where I am studying math. I will try to update this later with more facts about me, but for now I enjoy sailing, doing math, and I have ADHD.  To be expanded on at some point (hopefully).

## Interests

At the moment, I find myself broadly interested in homotopy theory and related flavors of general abstract nonsense, including condensed math and analytic geometry, higher category theory, higher algebra, equivariant homotopy theory, and tensor triangular geometry.  I am also somewhat interested in number theory (especially in learning about its connections to homotopy theory).

## What I'm Reading

Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the books/lecture notes that I am currently reading (feel free to reach out if you want to talk about any of them):
* [Lectures in Analytic Geometry](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf)
* [Elements of Infinity Category Theory](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf)
* [Homological Theory of Representations](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/HomTheRep.pdf)
* [Differential Cohomology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12250.pdf)
