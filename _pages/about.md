Hello, my name is Lucas Hou!

Some facts about me: I enjoy skiing and winetasting, lately I seem to be listening to a lot of Frank Ocean, and I love matcha.

Currently I am trying to get my ski instructor certification and learn Russian.

## Interests

I am primarily interested in homotopy theory and CS.

Everyone likes the Mumford quote, “[Algebraic geometry] seems to have acquired
the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly
plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is accurate.”     
This description I believe also applies quite aptly to homotopy theory these days, and I'd like to further the plot.
