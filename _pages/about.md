Hello, my name is Logan Hyslop, and I am currently a second year undergraduate at UCLA, where I am studying math.  Some facts about me: I enjoy sailing and doing math, lately I seem to be listening to a lot of Kid Cudi, and I have ADHD.

UCLA doesn't really have undergraduate theses/advisors, but I suppose my "pseudo-advisor" (which is something I made up while writing this) is [Paul Balmer](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~balmer).

## Interests

I am primarily interested in homotopy theory and number theory.

Everyone likes the Mumford quote, “[Algebraic geometry] seems to have acquired
the reputation of being esoteric, exclusive, and very abstract, with adherents who are secretly
plotting to take over all the rest of mathematics. In one respect this last point is accurate.”     
This description I believe also applies quite aptly to homotopy theory these days, and I'd like to further the plot.



## Resources I like

Here's a (somewhat unorganized) selection of some of the books/lecture notes that I have come across, and recommend for certain topics
* [Lectures on Condensed Math](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Condensed.pdf)
* [Lectures in Analytic Geometry](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf)
* [Categorical Homotopy Theory](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/cathtpy.pdf)
* [Elements of Infinity Category Theory](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf)
* [Lecture notes for learning E_n algebras](https://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~harpaz/lecture_notes.pdf)
* [Homological Theory of Representations](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/HomTheRep.pdf)
* [Differential Cohomology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.12250.pdf)
* [Equivariant Homotopy Theory Notes](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/a.debray/lecture_notes/m392c_EHT_notes.pdf)

To insert a shameless plug, [here are slides](/files/YouCouldHaveCondensedMath.pdf) from a talk I gave entitled You Could've Condensed Mathematics.  The talk was designed for undergraduates, meant to be a very non-technicaly introduction to some of the ideas of condensed math.<!--- (Note to self, eventually try to make slides for an analysis-oriented audience with more details) -->  

For a more technical introduction, [here is a video](https://researchseminars.org/talk/HomotopyTheoryAndApps/46/) of a talk I gave introducing condensed math and analytic geometry, starting from the beginning and ending with the definition of analytic spaces. (See my CV for more details and more of my talks).
