My name is Logan Hyslop, and I am currently a second year undergraduate at UCLA. I will try to update this later with more facts about me, but for now I enjoy sailing, doing math, and I have ADHD.  To be expanded on at some point (hopefully).

Interests
======
At the moment, I find myself broadly (though not an exhaustive list) interested in condensed math and analytic geometry, higher category theory, higher representation theory, Khovanov homology, and tensor triangulated geometry.

What I'm Reading
====
Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of some of the books/lecture notes that I am currently reading (feel free to reach out if you want to talk about any of them):
* [Lectures in Analytic Geometry](https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf)
* [Elements of Infinity Category Theory](https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf)
* [Homological Theory of Representations](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~hkrause/HomTheRep.pdf)
